Applying the AI Project Cycle to the Pneumonia Detection issue. This project apply:
- Use OpenCV for image processing procces
- Image data augmentation = rotation, rescale, zoom,flipping, etc
- Use sequential model in keras = Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
- Use accuracy and loss plot, accuracy = 73% and loss = 2.86% and confusion matriks with prediction in Pneumonia (precission = 0.7, recall = 1, f1-score = 0.82) and Normal (precission = 1, recall = 0.29, f1-score = 0.45).
